## About the language

Haskell is a standardized general-purpose, purely functional programming language with non-strict semantics and strong static typing. It gets its name from Haskell Curry. There are multiple iterations of Haskell  

# History

## Haskell 1.0 to 1.4 (1990 – 98)
------------------------------

   The first version of Haskell was defined in 1990. It had multiple series of language definitions (1.0 – 1.4). 
		
## Haskell 98 (1998 – 2010)
------------------------

   In late 1997, Haskell 98 was created. This was intended to be a stable, minimal, and portable version of the language. It also contains a library for teaching. This version would be the base for the next iterations of the language. The committee also welcomed creating extensions and variants of Haskell 98 by adding and incorporating experimental features. 
		
## Haskell 2010 (2010 – )
----------------------

   In early 2006, the committee started defining a successor to Haskell 98. This was going to be an incremental process meaning the language would get revised and updated once a year. In November 2009, Haskell 2010 was announced and released in July 2010. This version contained changes and additions like:
		
1.	Hierarchical Module Names 
2.	The Foreign Function Interface 
3.	Update to the rules of type interference 
4.	Changed grammar error in syntax

# Features

* Haskell features lazy evaluation, lambda expressions, pattern matching, list comprehension, type classes and type polymorphism.

* It is a pure functional programming language

* Has a strong static type system

* Has an active and growing community with more than 5,4000 third-party open-source libraries and tools. 



## About the syntax

*How to print "Hello, World!"*

```haskell
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
```
*Sum a number with itself*

```haskell 
doubleItself x = x + x 

main = putStrLn (show (doubleItself 6))
-- >12
```
*Basic if-else statement*

```haskell
doubleSmallNumber x = if x > 100
                    then x
                    else x*2

main = putStrLn (show(doubleSmallNumber 5))
-- >10
```

## About the tools

> _Describe the compiler or interpreter needed_.

Haskell uses the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). It is an open-source native code compiler for Haskell. The lead developers are Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow. It supports many extensions and libraries as well as having optimizations that streamline the process of generating and executing code. GHC is written in Haskell however the runtime system is written in C and C-. It supports both Haskell 98 and Haskell 2010. 

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

Class ```Array``` Constructs an immutable array from a pair of bounds and a list of initial associations.

``` haskell
import Data.Array

myArray = array (1, 3) [(1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c")]

main = do
    print myArray -- prints the array
    -- > array (1,3) [(1,"a"),(2,"b"),(3,"c")]
    print $ myArray ! 2 -- value at the given index
    -- > "b"
    print $ bounds myArray -- bounds with which the array is constructed
    -- > (1,3)
    print $ indices myArray -- list of indecies in ascending order
    -- > [1,2,3]
    print $ elems myArray -- list of elements in index order
    -- > ["a","b","c"]
    print $ assocs myArray -- list of associations of an array in index order
    -- > [(1,"a"),(2,"b"),(3,"c")]
 ```
 
Class ```Enum``` defines operations on sequentially ordered types.

```haskell
main = do
    print $ succ 'a' -- successor of value
    -- > 'b'
    print $ pred 'b' -- predecessor of value
    -- > 'a'
    print $ (toEnum 65 :: Char) -- convert from an int to a char
    -- > 'A'
    print $ fromEnum 'B' -- convert to an int
    -- > 66

    print $ take 10 $ enumFrom 'a' -- take the first 10 char starting from 'a'
    print $ take 10 $ ['a'..] -- take the first 10 char starting from 'a'
    -- > "abcdefghij"

    print $ take 10 $ enumFromThen 'a' 'c' -- take the first 10 characters with the pattern with 'a' and 'c' (so every other character)
    print $ take 10 $ ['a', 'c'..] -- take the first 10 characters with the pattern with 'a' and 'c' (so every other character)
    -- > "acegikmoqs"

    print $ enumFromTo 'a' 'e' -- sequence of values with the ranges 
    print $ ['a'..'e'] -- sequence of values with the ranges
    -- > "abcde" 

    print $ enumFromThenTo 'a' 'c' 's' -- sequence of every other value stopping at 's'
    print $ ['a', 'c'..'s'] -- sequence of every other value stopping at 's'
    -- > "acegikmoqs"
```
